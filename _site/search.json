    "text": "The grammar of graphics (Wilkinson 1999, 2005) provides a declarative, object-oriented framework to visualize statistical information as a collection of objects. It is noted that this grammar is not a separate command language, nor is it exhaustive – it is “not designed to produce every graphic imaginable”. The grammar of graphics can be designed atop any programming language, yet most discussions in Graphics Group are around R, to the extent that a survey last year with Monash University’s NUMBATs group did not even provide an option for any other programming language for data visualization. However, it has been (recently) confirmed that graphics can exist without R, and so in this presentation, we shall have a quick look at statistical graphics packages in Python, and discuss their capabilities with respect to the well-known ggplot2 via a few illustrative examples.\n\nLeland Wilkinson, The Grammar of Graphics (1st ed), 1999.

On average, over 100 traffic incidents are daily incidents are reported in ATMS, from crashes and vehicle fires to slow traffic and stalled vehicles. In order to make understand the spatial component of them, trends, summaries and severity, we have developed an interactive dashboard in shiny.\nI will describe the challenges and decisions I made to combine old information and up-to-date information; the tables and figures used to summarize the information; the additional sources of information to provide context to the incidents; and the upcoming and tentative changes to it. I will briefly talk about the technical aspects of the dashboard; it was developed in shiny using a wide variety of packages, like the whole tidyverse, sf, plotly, DT, and leaflet."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The creation of a data visualization depends on both analytic design and graphic design. Analytic designs focus on the structure of a chart and how data are encoded onto structural pieces such as length, area, and angle. Graphic design focuses on the use of supporting visual elements such as colors, patterns, and supporting context. Our work tests how viewers interact with three elements of modern data visualization: structure, aesthetics, and interpretation. Unlike studies from the past, which used small convenience samples, we utilize NORC’s AmeriSpeak panel, a nationally-representative probability sample, to test how well viewers make decisions from data visualizations with varying structure and aesthetics. In this talk, we will discuss previous work testing graphical perception of structural elements, describe our approach to testing, and share some initial results.\n\nThis is joint work with Nola du Toit, Ed Mulrow, and Heike Hofmann."

    "title": "The ggdensity package",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A popular strategy for visually summarizing bivariate data is plotting contours of an estimated density surface. Most commonly, the density is estimated with a kernel density estimator and the plotted contours correspond to equally spaced intervals of the estimated density’s height. Notably, this is the case for geom_density_2d() and geom_density_2d_filled() from ggplot2. ggdensity extends ggplot2, providing more interpretable visualizations of density estimates based on highest density regions (HDRs). geom_hdr() and geom_hdr_lines() serve as drop-in replacements for the aforementioned ggplot2 functions, plotting density contours that are chosen to be inferentially relevant. By default, they plot the smallest regions containing 50%, 80%, 95%, and 99% of the estimated density (the HDRs). This results in very interpretable graphics, conveying more information than arbitrary density contours. ggdensity allows for the plotting of contours of densities estimated via methods other than the standard kernel density estimator. Densities can also be estimated by histograms, frequency polygons, and fitting a parametric bivariate normal model. Also included are the functions geom_hdr_fun() and geom_hdr_fun_lines() for plotting HDRs of user-specified probability density functions. This allows for the plotting of a much larger class of HDR estimators than the four available for geom_hdr(). Users can specify and estimate arbitrary parametric models, providing the resulting pdf estimates to geom_hdr_fun() for contouring."
