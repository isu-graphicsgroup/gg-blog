Interactive dashboards are the most common use cases for data visualization and context for exploratory data tools. In our paper, we will explore the specific scope of how dashboards are used in small and rural areas to empower novice analysts to make data-driven decisions. Our framework will suggest a number of research directions to better support small and rural places from shrinking using an interactive dashboard design, implementation, and use for the everyday analyst.\n",
