My research project involved two phases: unsupervised learning, and supervised learning.  The intent of this project was to understand land types where bald eagles might be at greater risk of collision with industrial wind turbines to inform placement of wind farms.\n\nSee corresponding research article, [Classifying behavior from short-interval biologging data: An example with GPS tracking of birds](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ece3.8395) in *Ecology and Evolution*.\n\n",
