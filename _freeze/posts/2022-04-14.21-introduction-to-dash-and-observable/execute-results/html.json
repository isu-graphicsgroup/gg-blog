For the next two graphics-groups, we'll talk about two alternatives to Shiny which also use reactivity: \n\n-\tDash, using Python\n-\tObservable, using JavaScript\n\nAs examples, we'll talk about how you can build the same app using all three tools. For the first session, we'll discuss Shiny and Dash.\n\nHere's a reference I'm working on: https://ijlyttle.github.io/reactivity-three-ways-quarto/. If you like, you can have a read through the Shiny chapter to set the stage. We'll focus on the Python chapter this Thursday.\n\nAs well, I have built an RStudio Cloud project that ***you*** can use on Thursday to try out the Dash app -- all you would need to do is sign up for the ***free*** level of RStudio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free.\n",
