### We like to talk about graphics 

explore data  with graphics, \
trash talk bad graphics, \
discuss what good graphics should look like, \
discuss why some *should be better* don't end up in *are better* - graphically speaking, \
come up with a new type of graphic, \
use graphics in a new way, \
use graphics in an old way - but better, \
use graphics our own way. \

### We want to move the field of statistical graphics towards FAIRness

All research should be [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
Graphics as well. Open-access and reproducibility are important to us. 

### We like Cookies!

Traditionally, graphics group has aimed at an integration of baked goods and talks. All of this practice makes us practically perfect!



## Did you know?

The Graphics Group started in 2001, as part of an NSF VIGRE training grant to the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. 

VIGRE stands for Vertically InteGrated Research and Education. Vertical means that you do not have to be an expert yet, nor do you need to be a graduate student. **Everybody** is welcome!
