description: | 
 Multivariate spatio-temporal data have a spatial component referring to the location of each observation, a temporal component recorded at regular or irregular time intervals, and multiple variables measured at each spatial and temporal value. Often, such data are fragmented, reflecting a common practice of focusing on either spatial or temporal aspects separately. This fragmentation makes it difficult to handle them coherently and comprehensively. This work introduces a new data structure to facilitate the study of different portions or combinations of spatio-temporal data for exploratory data analysis. The proposed structure, implemented in the R package, cubble, organizes spatial and temporal variables as two facets of a single data object, allowing them to be wrangled separately or combined while ensuring synchronization. Examples will be provided to visualize weather station data with cubble using glyph maps.
