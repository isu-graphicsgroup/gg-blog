 Finding papers for literature reviews can be a tedious process. In this presentation, I will introduce Research Rabbit, a free application for finding connected papers and discovering networks of research areas. Research Rabbit allows you to create a collection of papers, follow citations/references, and more! With a Zotero integration tool, this application can help speed up the research process and make exploring papers more fun. I will give a live demonstration of Research Rabbit while we explore new papers together.
