The grammar of graphics (Wilkinson 1999, 2005) provides a declarative,
object-oriented framework to visualize statistical information as a collection
of objects. It is noted that this grammar is not a separate command language,
nor is it exhaustive -- it is "not designed to produce every graphic
imaginable". The grammar of graphics can be designed atop any programming
language, yet most discussions in Graphics Group are around R, to the extent
that a survey last year with Monash University's NUMBATs group did not even
provide an option for any other programming language for data visualization.
However, it has been (recently) confirmed that graphics can exist without R,
and so in this presentation, we shall have a quick look at statistical graphics
packages in Python, and discuss their capabilities with respect to the
well-known ggplot2 via a few illustrative examples.\
