We will discuss another paper by Ian Spence - this time we  focus on the 1991 paper "Displaying proportions and percentages" co-authored with Stephan Lewandowsky.
Again, the discussion will center on the user experiment and conclusions drawn. 
Make sure to read (or at least read over) the paper below.
