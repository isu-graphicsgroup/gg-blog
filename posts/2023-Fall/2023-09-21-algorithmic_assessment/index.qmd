  The comparative evaluation of aluminum wire cuts holds considerable significance within the field of forensic science. Nonetheless, there exists an absence of a systematic algorithmic framework for assessing their degree of similarity. In our recently introduced algorithm, we address this void by undertaking an examination of surface cuts presented in the x3p format.

The outcome of this algorithmic procedure consists of cross-correlation values, which serve as measurements for the similarity. In order to enhance the precision of this process, a sequence of multiple procedural steps has been integrated into the algorithmic pipeline. These steps encompass various methodologies, including imputation, Hough transformation, and maximum likelihood estimation.
