  You Draw It’ is a feature that allows users to interact with a chart directly by drawing a line on their computer screen with a mouse. Originally introduced by the New York Times in 2015 for the purpose of interactive reading, we aimed to adapt and demonstrate the use of the ‘You Draw It’ method as a tool for interactive testing of graphics.

This summer, I bundled the ‘You Draw It’ feature into an Rpackage and added additional functionality to the tool. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of my GSOC experience, the functions in the package, and give you a chance to test it out and code yourself! Please bring your computer.
